  The poem below is between pre tags which allows any text formatting like here the stanzas of poem below:
  <pre>
  Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

            My little horse must think it queer   
            To stop without a farmhouse near   
            Between the woods and frozen lake   
            The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

            The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
            But I have promises to keep,   
            And miles to go before I sleep,   
            And miles to go before I sleep.
